# Coding Standards

### Q: Does the KBase project using any type of coding standards? Do you use a linter?

We aim to follow [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations), but we have some exceptions,
such as a line length of 100 characters. We don't have a linter. But you can use Flake80 on your code.
